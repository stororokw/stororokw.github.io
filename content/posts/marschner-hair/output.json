    "abstract": "Light scattering from hair is normally simulated in computer graphics using Kajiya and Kay’s classic phenomenological model. We have made new measurements of scattering from individual hair fibers that exhibit visually significant effects not predicted by Kajiya and Kay’s model. Our measurements go beyond previous hair measurements by examining out-of-plane scattering, and together with this previous work they show a multiple specular highlight and variation in scattering with rotation about the fiber axis. We explain the sources of these effects using a model of a hair fiber as a transparent elliptical cylinder with an absorbing interior and a surface covered with tilted scales. Based on an analytical scattering function for a circular cylinder, we propose a practical shading model for hair that qualitatively matches the scattering behavior shown in the measurements. In a comparison between a photograph and rendered images, we demonstrate the new model’s ability to match the appearance of real hair.",

    "abstract": "When rendering light colored hair, multiple fiber scattering is essential for the right perception of the overall hair color. In this context, we present a novel technique to efficiently approximate multiple fiber scattering for a full head of human hair or a similar fiber based geometry. In contrast to previous ad-hoc approaches, our method relies on the physically accurate concept of the Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Functions and gives physically plausible results with no need for parameter tweaking. We show that complex scattering effects can be approximated very well by using aggressive simplifications based on this theoretical model. When compared to unbiased Monte-Carlo path tracing, our approximations preserve photo-realism in most settings but with rendering times at least two-orders of magnitude lower. Time and space complexity are much lower compared to photon mapping-based techniques and we can even achieve realistic results in real-time on a standard PC with consumer graphics hardware.",
